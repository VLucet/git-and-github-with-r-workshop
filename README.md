# Git and github with R Workshop - November 2019 👩‍💻 👨‍💻

This workshop makes use of different sources of online learning materials. 

## Part 1: Introduction

### O sensei, Linus Torvalds
The mind behind linux (listen until ~9:20): https://youtu.be/o8NPllzkFhE?t=433
Linus Torvalds created git because he was frustrated with existing version control softwares (like cvs https://www.nongnu.org/cvs/). Now, thousands of people use it. **Today you are going to become one of those people! 🎉**

### Preparation (before the workshop)
**(1) Complete section 1 of the happywithgithr workshop (“Installation”)**

1. Register on GitHub. https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html
2. Install or update R and Rstudio https://happygitwithr.com/install-r-rstudio.html
3. Install git https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html
4. Configure git https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html
5. Install a git client: I will not cover all the git clients. 
	- I will show you how to use GitHub desktop (for Mac and Windows users), download here. 
	- If you are a linux user I recommend gitkraken instead (and will be happy to show you that too). 

*For people with more  experience in bash/terminal/programming, please consider also doing this next step. If you don’t feel comfortable doing this or are having issues with this, do not worry. Reach out to me a prior to the training so that I can help you.*

**(2) Complete one step from section 2 of the happywithgithr workshop (“Connect Git, GitHub, RStudio”). Set up SSH keys** https://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys.html. This step is important because it allows you not to have to put in your password all the time every time you push or pull.
