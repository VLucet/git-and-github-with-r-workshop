### Preparation (before the workshop)
**(1) Complete section 1 of the happywithgithr workshop (‚ÄúInstallation‚Äù)**

1. Register on GitHub. https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html
2. Install or update R and Rstudio https://happygitwithr.com/install-r-rstudio.html
3. Install git https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html
4. Configure git https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html
5. Install a git client: I will not cover all the git clients. 
	- I will show you how to use GitHub desktop (for Mac and Windows users), download here: https://desktop.github.com/. 
	- If you are a linux user I recommend gitkraken instead (and will be happy to show you that too). 

*For people with more  experience in bash/terminal/programming, please consider also doing this next step. If you don‚Äôt feel comfortable doing this or are having issues with this, do not worry. Reach out to me a prior to the training so that I can help you.*

**(2) Complete one step from section 2 of the happywithgithr workshop (‚ÄúConnect Git, GitHub, RStudio‚Äù). Set up SSH keys** https://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys.html. This step is important because it allows you not to have to put in your password all the time every time you push or pull.

### **Part 1: Introduction**
### Linus Torvalds, the mind behind git 
The mind behind linux (listen until ~9:20): https://youtu.be/o8NPllzkFhE?t=433
Linus Torvalds created git because he was frustrated with existing version control softwares (like cvs https://www.nongnu.org/cvs/). Now, thousands of people use it. **Today you are going to become one of those people! üéâ**

### What is git? "Git for humans" by Alice Bartlett
Alice Bartlett (https://github.com/alicebartlett) from the Financial times has made a great set of introductory slides to explain **5 key things** about git: 
https://speakerdeck.com/alicebartlett/git-for-humans

### **Part 2: Hands-on**
*The following is inspired from the excellent tutorial https://happygitwithr.com/ Thanks to them!*
*We will also use [this amazing website](https://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/#free-remote) as a visual aid*

### Exercise 1: Once upon a commit... üìñ

Let's start by creating a new directory in your home directory. Open the terminal on your computer if you are on Mac or Linux (or the git console if you are on Windows) and use the `mkdir` command like below (stands for "make directory"). The `cd` command, for "change directory", allows us to move into this new directory.

```{sh eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
cd ~ 			# Go to your home directory
mkdir gitWorkshop 	# Creates a new directory called gitWorkshop in your home directory
cd gitWorkshop 		# Moves to inside the new directory
```

Now that you have a fresh directory, we need to make it a git repository, aka a **repo** (i.e. a directory in which git is activated and is tracking files). To make this work you need to initialize git. It's simple: 

```{sh eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
git init		# This initialize git in your directory
```
```{}
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/vlucet/gitWorkshop/.git/
```
Now, let's create a file using the `touch` command and edit it with `nano`. We want to track all the changes to this file. The code below opens the nano editor which you might not have on your computer. `Nano` is a simple command line file editor. Once the file is opened, you will see an empty screen. Type in what you want. You can then close the editor with `ctrl+X`. Make sure to type `y` for yes and press `enter` to save the file. If you do not have nano or do not like it, you can open the file in any text editor, edit and and save it there.

```{sh eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
touch script_1.R	# Creates the file
nano script_1.R		# This opens the nano Text editor. 
```

We can now start to use git to track the changes we made to this file. With the `ls`, which lists everything in your directory, you can see the file you have created. By editing the empty file and saving it, we created a change in this file. At any time, git lets you know if you have modified a file, thanks to the `status` command.

```{sh eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
ls			# This lists the files in the directory. You should see your file listed!
git status		# Shows the current status of your repo with regards to git
```
```{}
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        script_1.R

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

Here `status` shows you multiple things: 

- The branch you are on (the master branch, more on that later). 
- It lists the latest commit (none yet) and the changes you've made since the last commit. 
- It lists if files are **untracked**. New files are untracked by default. Here the `script_1.R` is shown as untracked. **Let's change that.** To do so, here is a second command: `add`.

```{sh eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
git add -A		# This adds ALL (hence the -A) the changes you made to the git index. Your changes are now registered // You could also just do git add script_1.R if you wanted to
git status 		# Status now shows, in green, which changes have to be committed
```
```{}
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   script_1.R
```

The file is now tracked by git. We say the file is **staged**. It has been added to what we call the **index**. Note that you could now do more changes, and you would need to re-run `git add` to add them to the index. Those changes not yet fully registered by git, they are like a draft. When you want to take a snapshot of a file, it means you are readu to commit that change to the index. To commit your changes, simply use the `commit` command, along with a (useful) message:

```{sh eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
git commit -m "First commit - adding script1"	# the -m flag adds a message to a commit
```
```{}
[master (root-commit) e07b863] First commit - adding script1
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 script_1.R
```

Git will print a message summarising the changes you've made. Well done! You now master the very basics of git. Easy peasy lemon squizzy üçãüçπ. The git `log` command shows you the recent commit history. 

```{sh eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
git log						# Git log shows you the history
```
```{}
commit e07b863a1afad32e03ac44b05c2a63eeab523557 (HEAD -> master)
Author: VLucet <valentin.lucet@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Apr 8 18:19:53 2020 -0400

    First commit - adding script1
```

------

### Exercise 2: All roads lead to GitHub üõ£Ô∏è

After having created a repo on your local machine (and provided that you have configured git on your computer), you will be able to copy your repo to GitHub, an online hub for repositories. We call this **pushing**. After pushing, a copy of your repo will live on the github servers and will remain linked to the original copy. The GitHub copy is called a **remote**. 

- The first thing to do is to create the remote on github.com: 
	- log in at github.com. 
	- click on the green folder.
	- Give a name to your repo. It's good practice to the use the same name than your local git repo (it's also easier to remember that way!).
	- **Do not** add a `README.md` or `.gitignore`. The repo needs to be an **empty repo**.
- The next thing is to tell your local git that you have created a new remote. You will name this the **origin** remote. 

```{sh eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
git remote add origin https:...	   # Add here the URL of your git repo, for instance https://github.com/VLucet/gitWorkshoptest
```

Finally, it is time to **push** your repo. The first time you push, you have to tell git that the remote is an **upstream branch** (more on that later).

```{sh eval=FALSE, include=TRUE} 
 git push --set-upstream origin master	# This pushes and sets the remote as "upstream"
```
```{}

 * [new branch]      master -> master
Branch 'master' set up to track remote branch 'master' from 'origin'.
```
```{sh eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
 git push origin master			# If you try to push again, it will tell you that everything is up to date!
```
```{}
Everything up-to-date
```
There you go! you now have a copy of your repo on GitHub. Well done!

**Note:** it is also possible to start the repo on GitHub and download a **clone**. It is the opposite operation (see exercise 4).

------

### Exercise 3: The client is king: GitHub Desktop üëë

**Note: Linux users can use GitKraken for this step.** 

What if you don't want to type in commands all the time? You can use a GitHub client. It's a program that will provide an more user-friendly interface with git and GitHub. 

- Open GitHub Desktop. 
- You have the choice between **adding** a local repository or **cloning** one (downloading from GitHub). We will add the local repo we just created. 
  - Navigate to File => Add local repository => navigate to the path. Your repo is now added! 
- You can open your text file again and change it. 
- You can use the interface to **ignore**, **remove** or **add** changes and for commiting. 
- Pushing (and pulling) is only one click away, on the top right. 

------

### Exercise 4: Team Work makes the Dream Work üë©üë®

Form teams of 3. The youngest of the team will be the repo owner for this exercise. 

- Repo Owner, head over to github to create a new online repository. 
	- This time, make sure to initiate this repository with a **ReadMe** file. A `ReadMe` file is an important file for a repo, as it is there to describe the purpose of the repo and contains important metadata on that repo.
- In the `ReadMe`, type in the name of your favorite movie or TV show.
- Next step is for you to make a team by **inviting collaborators**.
  - Navigate to your repo settings. 
  - Go to `Manage Access` and click `invite a colaborator`
  - Add the members of your team by typing in their **GitHub Username**.  
- You can now all clone the repo. You can use GitHub desktop or the command line. Using the command line: 
```{sh eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
cd ~ 			# Navigate to your home folder again 
git clone *URL* 	# The URL of the repo created by the repo owner
```
Well done, you have no set up a team and you are now technically working on the same repo.

------

### Exercise 5: (Do The) Push and Pull ‚¨ÜÔ∏èüîÑ‚¨áÔ∏è

You are now ready to do yur first round of **pushing and pulling**.

To do so, we are going to use the repo you cloned at the previous exercise. The first step is to make sure you are up to date with the version of  the repo that is on GitHub. To do so, we use the `fetch` command. 

```{sh eval=FALSE, include=TRUE} 
git fetch  # Fetch compares your local version with the remote version but does not apply the new changes (if there are any)
```

The next step is for one of the team members (other than the repo owner) to make a change. Make a change to the Readme file for instance (maybe you teammate's favorite movie is *not* Sharknados 3. They'd be wrong, but still, they're welcome to change that...).

```{sh eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
nano README.md	# Reminder: nano is the console editor
```

Then, add, commit and push those changes

```{sh eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
git add -A 				# Once again, add all the changes
git commit -m "modified the README"	# Always add a useful message (unless it's 2:32am and then you can just say "gazoub."
```

```{}
[master 58c8cb7] modified the README
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

```{sh eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
git push origin master			# Push it!
```

```{}
Enumerating objects: 5, done.
Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
Delta compression using up to 12 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 313 bytes | 313.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
To github.com:VLucet/gitWorkshop.git
   a992c9a..58c8cb7  master -> master
```

Now, two of the team members are not in sync with the changes. These people can see it with a `fetch`. Below I cannot show the outputs but you should a little familiar with these by now!

```{sh eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
git fetch	# This will download the changes pushed by your team member
git status	# Always good to run status once in a while. Here it will tell you that you are 1 commit behind! 
```

To remedy to this, it is as simple as **pulling** the changes in your local repo. 

```{sh eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
git pull origin master	# Nice! Git will print a nice summary with green + and red -. How cute. 
```

Well done! You now know how to **push** and **pull**, **fetch** and **status** your way around a shared repo. You're the best.

------

### Exercise 6: Git of war üí£üí•

Now, let's do it again but a little differently. The one person in the group to not have edited the `README` should do it now on their machine. Please add and commit but **do not push yet**.

```{sh eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
git add -A 				# Once again, add all the changes
git commit -m "modified the README"	# Do not push!
```

Now, repo owner will go on github and change the file. There are many types of files that can be edited directly on GitHub, and the README file is one of them. For this exercise, please change the same line than the previous person. Commit the change to the repo.

Now, the person to have just changed the file on their machine will do the pulling procedure:

```{sh eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
git fetch 	# This fetches the changes
git status 	# WOW! Status says that the commits are different... this might cause a problem
git pull 	# There is now a "conflict" and you need to resolve it
```

You've created a conflict üò±. A conflict typically happens when you have commited a local change and are pulling a commit from remote that was made on that same line of code you just changed. See it illustrated below: 

![Git conflict illustrated](https://blog.developer.atlassian.com/wp-content/uploads/dac-import/merge-conflict.png)

Git doesn't know which changes to keep and which one to throw away. We need to make a choice: we call that doing a "commit merge". As illistrated below, git will compare the two streams of information:

![Commit merge](https://blog.developer.atlassian.com/wp-content/uploads/dac-import/merge-result.png)

You have 2 options: you can use the nano editor: or you can use a combination of GitHub Desktop/External editor. The Atom editor is especially useful. If using `nano`:

```{sh eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
nano *file*	# Opens file in nano 
```

When you open the conflicted file you will see code that is enclosed within `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======`. This corresponds to your local version of this line of code. Then between `=======` and `>>>>>>> 3f74688ab...` is the version corresponding to the commit (with the hash `3f74688ab...`) that you pulled from remote. You need to edit the file so that these various things, `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======` and `>>>>>>> 3f74688ab...` are no longer there. You can choose to keep either of the changes or both. 

Once you have made your changes, it is time to commit your change, and merge it with the remote repo. 

```{sh eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
git add -A 				# Once again, add all the changes
git commit -m "fixed the conflict"	# You fixed the conflict, better put a messgae indicating it!
git push origin master			# Push it!
git status				# All is good!
```

Well done! You've learned how to deal with conflicts! üí™

In addition, git clients like GitHub Desktop or GitKraken have their own editor for conflicts (demo).

------

### Exercise 7: The tree of git üå≥

A great way to make conflicst much more manageable is to use the magic of branching. Branches are like alternate timelines that allow you to work on a snapshot of the repo at a given time. You start by "branching out of the master branch": this copies the current version of the repo and allows you to make changes on a separate "branch". 

One of the team members should do the following. The first thing is to create the branch:

```{sh eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
git branch mynewbranch		# This simply creates the new branch
```

The branch is created, but you are still on the master branch. To be able to switch to the new branch, we need to "checkout' the branch:

```{sh eval=FALSE, include=TRUE} 
git checkout mynewbranch	# This makes you switch to the new branch
```

```{}
Switched to branch 'mynewbranch'
```

```{sh eval=FALSE, include=TRUE} 
git status 			# You are now on the new branch
``` 

```{}
On branch mynewbranch
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

***note***: *there is a shortchut to do those 2 commands in one line: `git checkout -b mynewbranch`*
You are now on the new branch! This branch is only on your local machine for now. Let's add some changes and then commit and push so that you branch is saved on the remote!

```{sh eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# Do some changes in your repo! They will only be part of the commit hostory of your branch
git commit -a -m 'added some changes to the new branch'  # Another shorcut to add and commit at the same time!
```

```{}
[mynewbranch 92b76fb] added some changes to the new branch
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

```{sh eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
git push origin mynewbranch 				 # Pushin    he new branch - you can also just type in "git push"
```

```{}
Enumerating objects: 5, done.
Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
Delta compression using up to 12 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 338 bytes | 338.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
remote:
remote: Create a pull request for 'mynewbranch' on GitHub by visiting:
remote:      https://github.com/VLucet/gitWorkshop/pull/new/mynewbranch
remote:
To github.com:VLucet/gitWorkshop.git
 * [new branch]      mynewbranch -> mynewbranch
```

Awesome! Now, while one of the team member is adding commits to their new branch, someone else should keep adding changes to the master branch. Once this is done, it is time to merge the new branch with the master branch. 

Merging means doing a "pull request": you are pulling the new branch into the master branch. You therefore need to checkout the master branch and then *pull* the new branch into the master.

```{sh eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
git checkout master	# You've switched to the master branch
```

```{}
Switched to branch 'master'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
```
```{sh eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
git merge mynewbranch	# this merges (opens a pull request and checks it against the master)
```

```{}
Updating 58c8cb7..92b76fb
Fast-forward
 script_1.R | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

```{sh eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
git push 		# this pushes the merging of the two branches 
```

```{}
Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
To github.com:VLucet/gitWorkshop.git
   58c8cb7..92b76fb  master -> master
   
```

Additionnaly, you can do all this by creating a pull request on github (**DEMO**). 

------

### Exercise 8: In Rstudio ‚ú®

There is value in being able to do all of this in the command line, because it allows to build a mental model of how git works, which is extremely useful if you do not have access to an UI (this is the case when you are working on a supercomputer for instance). That being said, you can do all of the above directly in RStudio.

**A note on the Git/Github/Rstudio nexus:** Rstudio has integrated git in its interface, what can be called the Git/Github/Rstudio nexus. This can turn out be a lovely thing, if after using it you find that it is a nice user experience ([this troubleshooting page is an illustration of my point](https://happygitwithr.com/troubleshooting.html)). My humble opinion is that it is not the best.. and that you should let Rstudio do what it is designed to do: help you be productive with R. For example, to be able to use version control in rstudio, you need to create a R studio project. I do not like to work with .rproj files in general (although there are some nice sides to it, but I will not get into this here). So my advice is the follwing: ***use rstudio to edit and run your R code, use the git command line or a git client to do version control***. Nevertheless, I am going to show you how Rstudio with Git works. 

- Step 1: Set up git in the global options. TOOLS => GLOBAL OPTIONS. This allows you to set the SSH key that Rstudio will use.  
- Step 2: Create a new Rstudio project. FILE => NEW PROJECT  
- Step 3: Go in TOOLS => VERSION CONTROL => PROJECT SET UP. You can initialise a new git repo here.   

*Note: you will not be able to push your repo to a remote through rstudio, you will need a git client for that. Another option is to initialize a repo on Github, clone it, and then create a new R project inside it. You will be then be able to push and pull.*
